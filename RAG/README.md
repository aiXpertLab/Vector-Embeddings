# RAG and Semantic Search

## Traditional Semantic Search:

**Pre-processing**: Text data is pre-processed, cleaned, and potentially transformed into numerical representations like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

**User Query**: The user submits a query which also undergoes pre-processing and embedding generation.

**Similarity Search**: The query embedding is compared to the pre-computed document embeddings to find similar documents based on their semantic meaning.

## ChromaDB Approach:

**Document Ingestion**: Documents are directly added to ChromaDB collections. ChromaDB internally processes and embeds the text data during ingestion.

**User Query**: The user submits a query directly in plain text.

**Semantic Search**: ChromaDB utilizes its internal embedding models and indexing structures to understand the query's meaning and retrieve relevant documents based on semantic similarity.

Therefore, while traditional semantic search might require upfront calculation and storage of document embeddings, ChromaDB simplifies the process by handling these steps internally. This allows users to focus on formulating their queries without needing specific knowledge about embedding generation or retrieval techniques.

> ChromaDB is a powerful tool for **searching and retrieving** information from large textual datasets, but it is not designed specifically for generating content like summaries.
